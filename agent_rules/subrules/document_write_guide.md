# Document writing guideline
This guide helps to produce high-quality documentation for software projects, prioritizing clarity, completeness, and developer usability.

## Audience & Language
- Default to writing documentation in Korean unless the task explicitly specifies another language.
- Identify the target audience (e.g., backend engineers, product managers, end users) and tailor terminology, level of detail, and examples to their needs.

## Document Scope
Support the following documentation categories (and similar developer-focused outputs):
- Planning & design documents (system/service abstracts, architectural decisions, component responsibilities)
- Problem analysis & solution documents (issue overviews, root cause analysis, mitigation plans, validation strategies)
- Structure & usage guides (library/tool overviews, API references, best practices, real-world usage scenarios)

## Working Principles
1. Lead with the final outcome: state what the reader will achieve or learn.
2. Apply "problem → solution → implementation" flow where applicable.
3. Use active voice, concise sentences, and consistent technical terminology.
4. Provide concrete examples, code snippets, diagrams, and tables to clarify complex topics.
5. Ensure every instruction or code sample is executable and verified.
6. Highlight key decisions (✅), deprecated items (~~strikethrough~~), and warnings (❗) for quick scanning.

## Structured Workflow
1. **Understand & Gather**
   - Confirm the documentation goal, audience, and constraints.
   - Collect existing specs, code references, designs, or discussions relevant to the topic.
2. **Organize & Outline**
   - Define a logical structure with clear headings and navigation.
   - Prioritize information by importance and reader tasks.
3. **Draft Content**
   - Write sections with explicit outcomes and actionable guidance.
   - Include step-by-step instructions, checklists, and decision points where useful.
   - Provide code blocks with syntax highlighting and real outputs.
4. **Review & Test**
   - Follow the instructions or examples exactly to validate accuracy.
   - Cross-check terminology consistency and update any stale information.
5. **Revise & Polish**
   - Tighten language, remove redundancy, and ensure sections can stand alone.
   - Add cross-links, diagrams, or tables if they improve comprehension.

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Documentation is clear, concise, and audience-appropriate.
- [ ] Technical details are accurate, current, and verified.
- [ ] Structure supports quick navigation and independent section reading.
- [ ] Examples, code snippets, and diagrams work as described.
- [ ] Grammar, spelling, and formatting meet professional standards.
- [ ] Action items, decisions, and warnings are explicitly marked.

## Delivery Format
- Provide well-structured Markdown with descriptive headings (##, ###), ordered/unordered lists, and tables when helpful.
- Use syntax-highlighted code blocks, annotated examples, and embedded links where necessary.
- Include diagrams or images only if they add significant clarity (describe them when graphical output is unavailable).
- End with metadata such as "Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD" and note any open questions or follow-up actions.
