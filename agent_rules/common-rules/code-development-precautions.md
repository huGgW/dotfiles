# Code Development Policy
Unified execution and precaution rules for coding agents.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Do not assume. Do not hide uncertainty. Surface tradeoffs early.**

Before implementation:
- State assumptions explicitly.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present options instead of silently picking one.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- If something is unclear, ask a focused clarification.

## 2. Mandatory Plan Agreement Gate

**No implementation before plan agreement.**

For every code-development request:
1. Propose a concise plan.
2. Get explicit user agreement on the plan.
3. Start implementation only after agreement.

After plan agreement:
- Execute autonomously without requesting approval at every sub-step.
- Ask again only when scope changes materially, new risk appears, or required information is missing.

## 3. Plan Format (Keep It Lightweight)

Use a plan format proportional to task complexity.

For small tasks:
```
1. [Change]
2. [Verify]
```

For medium/large tasks:
```
1. [Step] -> outcome: [expected result] -> verify: [test/check]
2. [Step] -> outcome: [expected result] -> verify: [test/check]
3. [Step] -> outcome: [expected result] -> verify: [test/check]
```

The plan must include:
- Scope boundaries (what will and will not be changed).
- Verification method (tests, build, lint, runtime check, or reproducible evidence).

## 4. Simplicity First

**Implement the minimum change that solves the requested problem.**

- No features beyond the request.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No speculative flexibility/configurability.
- No unnecessary error handling for impossible scenarios.

If 200 lines can be 50 with equal clarity and safety, simplify.

## 5. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what is required. Clean up only what your change makes unnecessary.**

When editing existing code:
- Do not refactor unrelated areas.
- Do not change adjacent formatting/comments without a direct reason.
- Match existing style and architecture conventions.
- If unrelated issues are noticed, report them instead of fixing without request.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions made unused by your change.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless requested.

Every changed line must be traceable to the approved plan.

## 6. Verification-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria, then verify with evidence.**

Examples:
- "Fix bug" -> reproduce with test/check, implement fix, confirm reproduction no longer fails.
- "Add validation" -> add failing cases first (when applicable), then make them pass.
- "Refactor" -> preserve behavior and confirm with relevant tests/checks.

At completion, provide:
- What changed and why.
- Files touched.
- Verification evidence (executed tests/commands or clear reason if not run).
- Known limitations or follow-up risks.

## 7. Clarification Rules

Ask clarification questions only when truly necessary:
- Ambiguity that materially changes implementation.
- Destructive/irreversible actions.
- Security/billing/production-impact decisions.
- Missing credentials or external values that cannot be inferred.

Otherwise, proceed using the approved plan.
